/**
 * This file is specific to the Plynd framework.
 * The rationale is that for development purposes it can be run in the browser when the application is not
 * published yet. Later, it has to be uploaded to Plynd servers, where it will be run.
 * The reason is that the endpoint to update the game state (Plynd.updateGame(...)) is not available from
 * the browser scope while in production, to avoid cheats.
 *
 * It can have any name, but if using require (as here), it has to be explicitly built with the module name 'server'
 * (as it currently is in tools/build.js).
 * Also, when uploaded to the server, it has to be a single file (it cannot load more files dynamically during execution)
 *
 * The logic for the game of connect 4 is simple :
 * - on a new event, check if the row is full, and then update the game state.
 * - in the case this event sees the win of the player, specify it to the server by using the
 * specific field 'gameOver' = true in the event. This will have the effect of updating the meta-state of the game.
 *
 * This should not share state with the rest of the app, as it will run in a specific environment when the application
 * is published. However it can share logic with the rest of the app (as here, where we use the module 'game' in both places)
