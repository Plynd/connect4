========

This is the code source for a Connect 4 game on Plynd.
It is recommended to read [the tutorial](http://blog.plynd.com/Creating-a-fully-multiplayer-TicTacToe-on-Plynd/) and start with the [code source](https://github.com/Plynd/TicTacToe) for the TicTacToe game first.

This code source for the Connect-4 game goes a little further and shows how to use [require](http://requirejs.org/) in order to organize and use common code between the server functions and the client-side code.
